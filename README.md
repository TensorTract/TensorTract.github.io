Self-Supervised Solution to the Control Problem of Articulatory Synthesis


Abstract:
<div style="text-align: right"> 
Given an articulatory-to-acoustic forward model, it is a priori unknown how its motor control must be operated to achieve a desired acoustic result. This control problem is a fundamental issue of articulatory speech synthesis and the cradle of acoustic-to-articulatory inversion, a discipline which attempts to address the issue by the means of various methods. This work presents an end-to-end solution to the articulatory control problem, in which synthetic motor trajectories of Monte-Carlo-generated artificial speech are linked to input modalities (such as natural speech recordings or phoneme sequence input)via speaker-independent latent representations of a vector-quantized variational autoencoder. The proposed method is self-supervised and thus, in principle, synthesizer and speaker model independent.
